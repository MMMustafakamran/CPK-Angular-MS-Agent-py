 *
 * Three services. Angular has no server route to host the Copilot Runtime the
 * way a Next app does, so the runtime is its own Node process
 * (frontend/server.ts) sitting between `ng serve` and the Agent Framework
 * backend. `npm run dev` in frontend/ starts the first two together via
 * concurrently; the backend is started separately.
 *
 * The port numbers are this repo's, not the other Angular repos': the backend
 * already owns 8200, so the runtime moved to 8201 and `ng serve` to 4202. That
 * is what lets this stack run beside the Agno and Mastra ones without either
 * having to move.
